Question 5
Please refer screenshots Q5_Output.png, sync.sh, dirA and dirB folders with txt files for command execution and output with below explanations:

1. Command: nano sync.sh
            
   Explanation: This command opens nano editor to edit file.


2. Command: chmod +x sync.sh
    
   Explanation: This makes the script file executable.

3. Command: mkdir dirA dirB
            echo "Hello World" > dirA/file1.txt
    	    echo "Hello World" > dirB/file1.txt
	    echo "Only in A" > dirA/file2.txt
	    echo "Only in B" > dirB/file3.txt
	    echo "Different content" > dirB/file1_diff.txt
   
   Explanation: The mkdir makes new directories dirA & dirB, echo command used to create and fill data in files with output redirection	


4. Command: ./sync.sh dirA dirB
   Output: Files only in dirA:
	   -------------------
	   file2.txt

	   Files only in dirB:
	   -------------------
           file1_diff.txt
           file3.txt

	   Common files comparison:
	   ------------------------
	   file1.txt : MATCH


  Explanation: Script file is executed with dirA and dirB as parameters, resulting in output with  fulfilling following tasks:
 List files present only in dirA
 List files present only in dirB
 For files with the same name in both directories, check whether their contents match
